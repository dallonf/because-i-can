# Because I Can

This is a collection of a bunch of random scripts and apps I build when I just wanna code something. Most are half-finished and abandoned, but most of them do something interesting in their current state.

Most scripts are written with Node.js because I gravitate toward JavaScript for things like this. One of these days I might try Python, Lisp, or some other trendy language to see how it works.

## AI and problem solving

* [Lexico Puzzle Solver](lexico-puzzle-solver/) (May 2013) - Calculates the solution to a crazy puzzle in an obscure game.

## Challenges

* [Quine](quine.js) (May 2013) - A basic [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) in JavaScript. Nothing fancy, I just discovered that they existed and wanted to try one.
