# Because I Can

This is a collection of a bunch of random scripts and apps I build when I just wanna code something. Most are half-finished and abandoned, but most of them do something interesting in their current state.

Most scripts are written with Node.js because I gravitate toward JavaScript for things like this. One of these days I might try Python, Lisp, or some other trendy language to see how it works.

## AI and problem solving

* [Spoons Simulation](spoons/) (April 2019) - Simulates a game of Spoons.
* [Connect Four](connect-four/) (December 2014) - Plays Connect Four. Usually wins.
* [Lexico Puzzle Solver](lexico-puzzle-solver/) (May 2013) - Calculates the solution to a crazy puzzle in an obscure game.
* [Tic-Tac-Toe](tic-tac-toe/) (May 2013) - Wins Tic-Tac-Toe. Or at least ties. Because it really is *a strange game*.
* [Word Maker](wordmaker/) (March 2012) - Generates random, usually pronounceable gibberish.

## Data processing

* [TVTropes Crawler](tvtropes/) (March 2014) - Ranks TV Tropes entries by number of examples.

## Challenges and Exercises

* [2022 GMTK Game Jam Prep](gmtkjam-2022-prep/) (July 2022)
* [Quine](quine.js) (May 2013) - A basic [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) in JavaScript. Nothing fancy, I just discovered that they existed and wanted to try one.

## Game mechanic prototypes

* [Brute Force Hacking](brute-force/) (June 2014) A simulated brute force attempt testing just how fun it is to wait for an exponential process.
