# Because I Can

This is a collection of a bunch of random scripts and apps I build when I just wanna code something. Most are half-finished and abandoned, but all of them do something interesting in their current state.

Most scripts are written with Node.js because I gravitate toward JavaScript for things like this. One of these days I might try Python, Lisp, or some other trendy language to see how it works.
