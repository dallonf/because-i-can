# TIC-80 Dice Effect

I wanted to use TIC-80 for my 2022 GMTK Game Jam entry, which wound up being [This Is Definitely How Dice Work](https://meanwhile.itch.io/definitely-how-dice-work), made in Unity, because I realized I could either make a 3D spinning dice in TIC-80, or an entire game in Unity over the weekend.

But I still wanted to make that effect work after the jam! So I did.

Also see [Dice Effect in p5.js](../processing-dice/) for some sketches I did to help with the math.

Note there's also some infrastructure here to make a multi-file TIC-80 project work, in preparation for the jam.
